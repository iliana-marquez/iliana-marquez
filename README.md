## üëã Hola!  

### I'm **Iliana**... Full Stack Developer by choice ü§ì

üó∫Ô∏è **My Roadmap:** Singer ‚Üí International Retail ‚Üí Developer

#### üåü How did I get here? Funny story...
I started as an **opera singer** (yes, really! From music to Git Stages üòÖ), which brought me to Vienna, the capital of music. Then I discovered and spent over a **decade in international retail** (yup, that too) managing teams and operations across countries. And naturally, the journey evolved - now I'm building web and software applications... so excited to keep growing in tech!

> ü§© *turns out, whether hitting high notes on stage, coordinating shipments across borders, or debugging Python code, it's all about collaboration, problem-solving & making things flow smoothly.*

üõ†Ô∏è **Currently** building tools that solve real problems for real users 

üá¶üáπ **Based in** Vienna, but work with teams internationally

üìù **Learning in public, cause sharing is caring** - Recently published my 1st article on OOP on [Medium](https://medium.com/@iliana.marquez/think-like-a-builder-my-first-real-understanding-of-oop-362717479060); more content in progress... 

üèîÔ∏è **Enjoy the outdoors** - hiking, skiing, and surfing when I am not coding  

üó£Ô∏è **Spoken languages** - Spanish, German, English, French & a bit of Italian
